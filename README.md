MODEL CREATION STEPS

Step 1: Library Import
This step imports the necessary libraries to allow proper functioning of the model.

Step 2: Data Import
This step imports the dataset into python for further use.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
In this step, the features are renamed to ensure readability and also unnecessary columns are dropped to reduce model training time and improve performance.

Step 4: Model Training
A Logistic regression model is trained using the train data split. this step trains the model based on a large part of the existing data and tests it using a small part of the data that was not used in the training.

Step 5: Model Evaluation
This step prints out the model metrics such as the classification report and the confusion matrix.
